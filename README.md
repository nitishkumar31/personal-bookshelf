# Personal Bookshelf

A responsive React application that allows users to search for books using the Open Library API and maintain a personal bookshelf using localStorage. The application provides real-time search results and a persistent storage solution, ensuring users can manage their book collection seamlessly across sessions.

## Features

- Real-time Book Search: Instantly fetch and display book results from the Open Library API as users type their queries.
- Persistent Bookshelf: Users can add books to their personal bookshelf, which is stored in localStorage for persistence across browser sessions.
- Interactive Interface: Intuitive design with dynamic components that enhance user engagement and provide a smooth experience.
- Navigation: Implemented with React Router DOM to enable seamless navigation between the search page and personal bookshelf page.

## Technologies Used

- React.js for building the user interface
- Axios for making API requests
- localStorage for data persistence
- React Router DOM for navigation
- CSS for styling and layout

## Project Setup:

### Clone the repository

### `git clone https://github.com/nitishkumar31/personal-bookshelf.git`

Navigate to the project directory:

### `cd personal-bookshelf`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
